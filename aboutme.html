      I have been living in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa for
      about 11 years. My wife Heather and I have been blessed with three
      wonderful children, Rehema(8) , Hannah(3), and Daniel(4 months old). I
      went for work purposes in the eastern parts of South Africa and it was
      very refreshing with the slow laid back pace of life. Joburg is highly
      populated with lots of challenging stuff like the rate of crime which is
      too high and a very high cost of life. We however keep to the safe zones
      and stay out of harms way by all means. Going on mission is on my bucket
      list and I hope to serve with my wife in the future. I hope to learn many
      technologies through my CIT Major to eventually get into infosec/
      Cybersecurity in the future. I believe more human resources are needed to
      fight the scourge of hackers causing mayhem in society. I would like to
      give my contribution towards this cause!
