    <p>The internet and our going online to search or buy items has become a normal way of
       our day to day life. This has now become almost a basic necessity to the extent that
       we mostly approach our interactions without a good level of caution.
    </p>
    <p>Most web applications require us to fill in and submit some level of our personal Information
      for us to use them. Many businesses with an online presence also want our personal data so that
      they can communicate with us through emails or for us to log in to their platforms. This is 
      where the danger arises. Most people use very weak passwords or those that are easy to crack.
    </p>
    <p>From the above image, you can see how easy or hard it is for someone with malicious intent to
      get hold of your password and end up eventually having your personal information which they can 
      then use to scam you or worse still to even impersonate you and commit crime.
    </p>
    <p>It is very important not to be too trusting online. Treat almost all interactions online with
      with a decent level of suspicion especially if it involves your parting with sensitive information
      like credit card numbers and passwords. see more advice below!
    </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Make sure that you use complex passwords with a mixture
          of characters and numbers. Easy passwords are a no no!. Don't use 
         names that someone can collect through your social media profile.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2. Before you sign up for any service online, ask yourself
          if you are signing up for an essential service and if you 
          can not do without. Avoid the developing a habit of signing up 
        for everything</strong>
        </li>
        <li><strong>3. If you are about to release your personal information 
          in order to get access to something online, it is important
          to do due diligence first just to find out if the company is 
          reputable.</strong>
        </li>
        <li><strong>4. Read the terms of service and how your information will
          be stored and used. Check if you can unsubscribe from the 
          service at any time without complications.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

         <strong>too good to be true</strong>, in most cases
         it is a <em>scam!</em>".
