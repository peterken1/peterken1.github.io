    <div class="questions">
      <h4>
        1.What should I do when I receive an email that looks legitimate asking for 
        confirmation of password and pin number?
      </h4>
    <p>Never give out sensitive information online until you verify the sender of the 
      email. Most organizations like banks not ask for PINS and other sensitive information
      through email. You can also call your bank and service provider to verify.
    </p>

    <div class="questions">
      <h4>
        2.What should I do if I suspect that I have been scammed online?
      </h4>
      <p>You have to report to relevant authorities immediately and provide 
        all the information that may help them track the scammers. This may 
        help protect other people from being scammed.

        <h4>
          3.How do I know my child will be safe online?
        </h4>
     <p>More children have access to the internet at an earlier age than in the past.
       They also have smart phones and access to other computing devices. This is a 
       two edged dilemma in which it is good for them to view content that can build 
       them, but unfortunately they may bump into negative content like porn or 
       extreme violence. The best you can do is activate parental controls in most 
       websites. Sit and advice them on inherent dangers online.

      <div class="questions">
        <h4>
          4.Will I be able to keep up with all the tech changes?
        </h4>
     <p>Most likely not BUT you have to make sure that you are up to date on all 
       the essential applications that you use because this can be a very bad 
       blind-spot. Get to know and understand all the applications that you use 
       and try not to overload yourself on new tech and apps.

      <div class="questions">
        <h4>
          5. What should I do to prevent people from accessing files on my devices ?
        </h4>
        <p>The best you can do is install antivirus software and make sure that your 
          devices firewalls are always turned on and are current. The next best thing 
          to do is to always back up your files in storage devices that people can't 
          access online.
